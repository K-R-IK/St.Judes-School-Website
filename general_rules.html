    <ol class="gd-rules">
      <li id="rule-1">
        <strong>Students are urged to contribute to the high standard of the School</strong> by their manners and general behaviour. For smooth running, no student should bring objects that cause disturbance.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Posture, cleanliness, silence, politeness and respect</strong> — the school is a place of reverence and discipline; students must reflect this in conduct toward teachers and peers.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Absolute silence</strong> must be maintained in teaching hours — in the library, labs, computer room, assembly or while moving between classes.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Respect school and others’ property.</strong> Furniture, teaching aids and charts must be returned to their places after use. Any damage must be made good.
      </li>

      <li id="rule-5">
        <strong>English is the medium on the premises.</strong> Students must use English to improve proficiency and maintain a high standard of conversation.
      </li>

      <li id="rule-6">
        <strong>No unauthorized items.</strong> Books, newspapers, games, cell phones, radios, watches or electrical instruments not related to school work must not be brought without permission. Items with a bad influence will be confiscated; students may be punished.
        <div class="gd-note">
          <em>Penalty:</em> Possession of a phone, wrist watch or electronic gadget — fine of ₹500 and device confiscated and retained for the academic year. Repeat offence: fine doubled and device destroyed; further offence may lead to expulsion.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>School is not responsible for personal losses.</strong> Students should avoid bringing valuables. If items are brought for genuine reasons they must be handed to the Principal/Headmistress or a teacher and collected after school.
      </li>

      <li id="rule-8">
        <strong>Discipline measures.</strong> The Principal may chastise for habitual idleness, disobedience or misconduct, detain after hours, impose minor punishments, or in serious cases dismiss or ask a student to discontinue.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>No collections or fines</strong> without prior sanction of the Principal. Presentation of gifts to staff also requires prior sanction.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Class monitor responsibility.</strong> In the teacher’s absence the class monitor/monitress maintains order with loyalty and impartiality.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Assigned responsibilities</strong> must be executed dutifully and impartially as directed by the Principal or deputed teacher.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Individual approach to the Principal.</strong> Students may approach the Principal individually for reasonable or sympathetic consideration — not in groups.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>No private tuition by staff</strong> without written permission from the Principal. Such tuitions must stop one week before examinations.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Assembly procedures.</strong> When the first bell rings, students must get into class queues for Assembly to pray and listen silently to announcements.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Attendance at Assembly.</strong> Every student should attend Assembly to begin the day with prayer and receive important announcements.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Be courteous and cooperative.</strong> Treat all students with respect and behave in a dignified manner.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Come prepared and in proper attire.</strong> Arrive on time, neatly dressed, with lessons prepared and homework done. Bring text and material required for the day’s routine.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Keep classrooms and the compound clean.</strong> Use bins provided for waste — maintain spotlessly clean premises.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Staff-room access.</strong> Students are not allowed to visit the staff-room without prior permission of the Principal or a teacher.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Serious misconduct.</strong> Persistent insubordination, willful mischief, examination malpractice, or behaviour judged by the Principal to be an unwholesome influence may result in temporary removal or permanent expulsion.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Assault or demoralizing behaviour.</strong> Assaulting a teacher, serious attacks on students, or persistent rude behaviour may lead to permanent removal.
      </li>

      <li id="rule-22">
        <strong>Punctuality & entry.</strong> Repeated lateness, forgetting books or coming without proper uniform may be punished and fined. Students arriving five minutes after Assembly will not be allowed entry.
      </li>
