    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="section-list" class="rules">
      <ol class="rules-list">
        <li>Parents are expected to co-operate with the School authorities and the teacher by enforcing regularity and discipline, supervising lessons, taking active part in the School activities and by sending the boys/girls with proper uniform.</li>

        <li>Occasional remarks from the teachers and the Principal are made in the School diary for the information of the parents. In such cases they should never fail to sign the diary so as to show their acknowledgement.</li>

        <li>Parents are expected to sign the note books when they are sent for it. Failure to do so may put their children to great inconvenience. They should particularly check their leave and absence records.</li>

        <li>When communicating with the Principal, parents/guardians are requested to mention in their letter the name of the students, class and section.</li>

        <li>Parents are strictly forbidden to interview their children and the teacher in the class or the staff member in the staff room without the permission of the Principal.</li>

        <li>Tipping the employees either during or after the School hours must be avoided at all costs.</li>

        <li>Parents must intimate the School whenever their residential address or telephone numbers are changed in order to communicate to them in urgent matters, in the interest of their children.</li>

        <li>Answer papers of the examination will be shown to the parents except annual examination. Application for verification of marks in special cases will be considered at the discretion of School authorities.</li>

        <li>They should insist on their children devoting enough time daily to learn their lessons before they come to School. On holidays some time should be devoted to study at homes.</li>

        <li>If parents or guardians find that their ward is not picking up right habits or is not progressing satisfactorily in his/her studies, they should make an appointment with the Principal to discuss the matter.</li>

        <li>Parents are requested not to send for their children during class hours except in case of unforeseen emergency and that too with the Principal's permission.</li>

        <li>Parents should understand that they cannot dictate to the Principal but that the Principal has the right to say on what conditions he will admit or retain pupils in the institution.</li>

        <li>Principal must be informed of the absence of the students at the earliest.</li>

        <li>Should there be any infectious disease in your home please report the fact to the Principal at once and do not send your child to the class till the child is fully cured. The Doctor's Certificate to attend the class must be brought the day the child is fit to join the School.</li>

        <li>If a student is likely to be absent through illness for a long period, the Principal must be informed immediately through an application with the name, class and section of their ward.</li>

        <li>Parents/Guardians are requested not to give money to children unless they receive a written notice from the School. Children should be provided with Tiffin lunch and fast food.</li>

        <li>Parents/Guardians are requested to send their wards to School in time and in clean and tidy full uniform.</li>

        <li>Tuitions are strongly discouraged. Parents who seek admissions in this School and look out for tutors, are taking a risk as they will depend on the sincerity of the tutors. Parents who have no time to give personal attention to their children should not admit or retain their children in this school.</li>

        <li>In spite of all help given, if a child fails to show any progress, the same may be discussed with the Principal/Head Mistress, Class/Subject Teachers and the Principal/Head Mistress may permit extra coaching by a member of the staff.</li>

        <li>
          To ensure integrity and dedication of the members of the staff, the following are the guidelines to the staff/parents/guardians in regard to private tuitions:
          <ol class="sublist">
            <li>No member of the staff of this institution may undertake a tuition without the sanction of the Principal.</li>
            <li>No staff member of this institution is permitted to visit the homes of the children to give tuition, and suggest the need of private tuition.</li>
            <li>A parent/guardian desirous of arranging a private tuition, from a member of this institution shall apply in writing to the Principal, who after ascertaining the merit of the application, will forward it to any member of the staff. The parents and teacher will accept the terms and conditions of the assignment from the Principal before commencing with tuition work.</li>
            <li>It is to be clearly understood by both parents and the tutors that coaching is an exception. It is primarily to help the child to gain confidence and right habit of study and as soon as the child is able to cope up with his studies, tuition should be discontinued.</li>
            <li>A teacher who values tuition work more than her/his dedication to duty and his/her work suffers, puts himself/herself in danger of having his/her service to the institution, terminated. Parents are requested not to bring pressure on a teacher in this regard but be conscious in their dealing in the matter.</li>
            <li>All tuition work shall end a week before the examinations commence.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Criticism of the teachers or of the School in the presence of children should be studiously avoided because it causes them to lose respect to those teachers and subsequent failure to learn form them. Should a parent have genuine complaint it may be brought to the notice of the Principal.</li>

        <li>Parents are exhorted not to listen to unwarranted gossips and spread the same as it causes untold damage to the institution. Let us remember that to build an institution, it requires many years of effort but to destroy, it can take only a day.</li>

        <li>Parents should always keep in mind that the School, its teachers and the parents are linked together in a continuous process for the education of the child. Even in difficult situations calm and gentleness should be displayed so that the atmosphere is cordial, realizing that the net result of recriminations fall ultimately on the child. If the relation with the School is not cordial, it is advisable for parents to shift their children to another institution of their choice.</li>
