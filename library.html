      <ol class="library-rules">
        <li>Strict silence has to be observed in the library at all times.</li>
        <li>No one is permitted to take a book from the library without the permission of the Librarian and having it duly entered.</li>
        <li>Books are issued to the use of the borrower and should not be lent to anybody else. Reference books will not be issued.</li>
        <li>Students should take great care in handling the books. Tearing of pages and pictures from books and magazines is an awfully bad habit which must be avoided at all costs.</li>
        <li>The attention of the Librarian must be drawn to the books that an intending borrower finds damaged.</li>
        <li>Damage done to the books and magazines must be made good by the borrower. In case the book is lost the entire cost has to be deposited with the Librarian.</li>
        <li>Failure to return a book by the due date incurs a fine of Rs. 5 per day for the time the book is overdue.</li>
        <li>Books and magazines taken out for reference must be placed in the same place from where they were taken.</li>
        <li>All books must be returned 3 days before the beginning of each examination. Failure to do so will debar the student from appearing at the examination.</li>
        <li>It is highly recommended that the students take the guidance of the teachers while selecting the books.</li>
